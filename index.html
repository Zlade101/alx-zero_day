            <li>4 large tomatoes (or 1 can of chopped tomatoes)</li>
            <li>2 red bell peppers (Tatashe)</li>
            <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper (Atarodo), adjust to taste</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped (divided)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend tomatoes, bell peppers, scotch bonnet, and half of the chopped onion until smooth.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil. Fry the remaining half of the chopped onion until translucent.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste and 
            <b>fry for 2-3 minutes to remove the sour taste.</b>
            </li>
            <li>Pour in the blended pepper mixture and fry the sauce until it thickens and the oil begins to float to the top (this is your stew base).</li>
            <li>Stir in the stock, curry powder, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and seasoning cubes. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
            <li>Wash the rice thoroughly <i>until the water runs clear</i> to remove excess starch.</li>
            <li>Add the washed rice to the boiling stew, stir until everything is well combined.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot tightly with aluminum foil before placing the lid on top. This traps steam and helps the rice cook evenly and develop a smoky flavor.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and allow the rice to steam and cook
            <mark> for 20-25 minutes without stirring</mark>.
            </li>
            <li>Fluff the rice with a fork before serving hot with your choice of protein (e.g., chicken, beef, fish).</li>
        </ol>
